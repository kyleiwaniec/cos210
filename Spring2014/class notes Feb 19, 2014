JComponent doesn't extend observable.

Swing has an event listener list instead.

addBlindsListener()  // addActionListener


EventListenerList

FireBlindsEvent(){
	
	take event list and iterate backwards by twos.
	lazy create the event
	fire event
}

Threading and Networking

Thread: single executable line of exacution which may be dispatched to another processor.

a collection needs to be protected.

a processor in order to change  variable, reads the var and writes to it.
read/write pair

"monitor" (semaphor)

all Objects have a Monitor bit. this means that when a processor reads data, no other processor has access to the data. nobody can do anything between the read and write.

We acquire the monitor when we need to do thread thread work.

all objects have a clone method (set to false), a toString, which we typically overwrite, as well as:

wait();
notify();
notifyAll();

functions can be declared to be synchronized.
like this instance method. the method is entered Serially. Only on ethread can hold the monitor.
public synchronized void doSomething {
	// all methods are sychronized
}

better pattern:

public void doSomething{
	
	synchronized () {} // a synchronized block inside.
}



who gets the next turn is not guaranteed.

synchronized (queue) {
	while(queue.isEmpty){
		queue.wait();  // could be a dealock??
		// when I call wait, I give up the monitor, with the guarantee that when I wake up, i will get the monitor back.
	}
	Foo foo = queue.remove();
}


Synchronized (queue){
	queue.add();
	queue.notify(); // will tell some thread somethere that is waiting on the moitor (above ^^) to awaken.
	queue.notifyAll(); // wakes up everybody waiting on the monitor. guarantees everyone to get the monitor at some point.
}


User Interface thread (supports drrwaing code, for example). this is thread is not "Thread safe", because there is onlu one.

a thread puts data on a queue.
send threads, one at a time pull messages off the queue and send to everybody.
the queue needs to be protected.

--------------------------------------------

Application layer - talks to Transpor layer via sockets(bidirectional)
Transport layer - TCP(connection based protocol) UDP
Network layer - IP
Ethernet

Server socket associates tcp port to server (TCP: guaranteed packet sending)
Regular sockets


UDP will not notify if packet was recieved. good for streaming video, where if a packet misses, that's OK.
UDP could be good for a game for sending positions quickly.


in the BUG game:
intermediate queues that need to be synchronized
bugworld creates a buggame

buggame creates a bugmodel and bugview

the view is where the bug drawing is.

add a feature to the codebase: such as: make it work with our bugs, or collision detection
